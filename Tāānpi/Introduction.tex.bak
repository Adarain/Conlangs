\subsection{About \lang}
\lang{} \langipa{} is an a priori naturalistic constructed language. This means that it is inspired by, but not based on natural languages. 

\subsection{About this Document}
This document is a collection of papers documenting not only the \lang{} language, but also its creation in general. Each paper will describe an aspect of the language as it is being created. Once a paper has been finished, it will no longer be edited, except to fix mistakes. If parts of the language are revised, then these changes will be documented in a new paper.
