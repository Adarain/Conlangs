**Goals**
- keep word order strict, but based largely on pragmatics rather than strictly syntax
- have unintuitive case morphology


**Categories**
- _Contrast_ implies that one or all other possible option for the same role are excluded from taking on that role. 
- _Topic_ is an entity which persists in discourse over multiple utterances and around which the discourse is in some sense centered.
- _Focus_ is an entity which is provided to answer an (implicit or explicit) question about the topic, or the question word itself
- _Definiteness_ singles out a particular instance out of a set of objects
- _Old information_ is a recurring object, whose relation to the action is known but which is stated again
- _Internal Argument_ is the syntactic role of S/P
- _Control_ marks whether an entity is able to influence the ongoing action (in a meaningful way). This does not necessarily mean that they _do_ influence the action.
- _Animacy_ marks things capable of decision-making (including things believed to have that capability, such as natural forces)

**Markers**
There are four case markers
* _Absolutive_ marks the internal argument (this overrides all)
* _Instrumental-Causal_ has two roles:
    * Animate entities with control
    * Inanimate entities without control
* _Dative_ marks animate entities without control
* _Essive_ marks adverbial nouns
* In prepositional phrases, indefinites are _essive_, definites are _inst-caus_ or _dat_ based on preposition.
Ã±-possessor marks a definite, animate external argument 

**Syntax**
* Slot 1: Contrast
* Old Information is backgrounded, which can manifest in three ways:
    * less prominent place in the word order (light NPs in short sentences primarily)
    * incorporation (light NPs in longer sentences, or to aid pivoting)
    * right dislocation (heavy NPs)
* words modifying the verb directly (e.g. adjectives referring to incorporand) precede the verb directly
